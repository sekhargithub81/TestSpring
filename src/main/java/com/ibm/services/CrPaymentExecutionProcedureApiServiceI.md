#### Example Usage

```java
// Assuming a class implementing CrPaymentExecutionProcedureApiServiceI
public class CrPaymentExecutionProcedureApiServiceImpl implements CrPaymentExecutionProcedureApiServiceI {
    @Override
    public InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse initiate(InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest initiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest) {
        // Implementation to initiate payment execution procedure
        // For demonstration, a simple return is shown
        return new InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse();
    }

    @Override
    public UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse update(String paymentexecutionid, UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest updatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest) {
        // Implementation to update payment execution procedure
        // For demonstration, a simple return is shown
        return new UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse();
    }

    @Override
    public RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse retrieve(String paymentexecutionid) {
        // Implementation to retrieve payment execution procedure
        // For demonstration, a simple return is shown
        return new RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse();
    }
}

CrPaymentExecutionProcedureApiServiceI service = new CrPaymentExecutionProcedureApiServiceImpl();

// Initiate payment execution procedure
InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest initiateRequest = new InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest();
InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse initiateResponse = service.initiate(initiateRequest);
// Process the initiate response

// Update payment execution procedure
String paymentExecutionId = "some-payment-execution-id";
UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest updateRequest = new UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest();
UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse updateResponse = service.update(paymentExecutionId, updateRequest);
// Process the update response

// Retrieve payment execution procedure
RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse retrieveResponse = service.retrieve(paymentExecutionId);
// Process the retrieve response
```

### Notes

*   The interface is designed to be implemented by a class that will provide the actual implementation for the defined methods.
*   It is part of a larger service-oriented architecture, likely within an enterprise application or a microservices-based system.
*   The specific implementations of the `initiate`, `update`, and `retrieve` methods are expected to be provided by a class implementing this interface, which may involve database queries, API calls, or other necessary operations to perform the respective payment execution procedure operations.

## Business Logic Documentation
### Input & Output Data Structures

* **Initiate Operation**
  - Input: `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest` object
  - Output: `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object
* **Update Operation**
  - Input: 
    - `paymentexecutionid` (string)
    - `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest` object
  - Output: `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object
* **Retrieve Operation**
  - Input: `paymentexecutionid` (string)
  - Output: `RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object

### Logical Flow

1. The `CrPaymentExecutionProcedureApiServiceI` interface defines a service for handling operations related to payment execution procedure.
2. The service includes three main operations: `initiate`, `update`, and `retrieve`.
3. **Initiate Operation**: 
   - The `initiate` method takes an `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest` object as input.
   - It processes the request and returns an `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object.
4. **Update Operation**:
   - The `update` method takes two input parameters: `paymentexecutionid` and an `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest` object.
   - Based on these inputs, it updates the details of a specific `Payment Execution Procedure`.
   - The method returns an `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object containing the updated details.
5. **Retrieve Operation**:
   - The `retrieve` method takes a `paymentexecutionid` as input.
   - It retrieves the details of a specific `Payment Execution Procedure` based on the `paymentexecutionid`.
   - The retrieved details are encapsulated in a `RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object.
   - The method returns the `RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse` object.

### Data Validation

- The input parameters and objects (`InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest`, `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest`, `paymentexecutionid`) are expected to be valid.
- The response objects (`InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse`, `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse`, `RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse`) are expected to be valid representations of the respective operation outcomes.

### Business Rules

The business logic is centered around three main operations related to `Payment Execution Procedure`:
1. **Initiation**: The `initiate` operation is used to start a payment execution procedure based on the details provided in the `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest`.
2. **Update**: The `update` operation is used to modify an existing `Payment Execution Procedure` identified by `paymentexecutionid` based on the details provided in the `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest`.
3. **Retrieval**: The `retrieve` operation is used to fetch the details of a `Payment Execution Procedure` identified by `paymentexecutionid`.

The relationships between `Payment Execution Procedure` and the request/response objects are maintained through the use of `paymentexecutionid` and the respective request/response objects.

### Error Handling Approach

The interface does not explicitly define an error handling approach. It is assumed that exceptions will be handled by the implementing class or the calling code.

### External Program Dependencies

- The interface depends on several classes from the `com.ibm.model` package, including `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest`, `InitiatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse`, `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureRequest`, `UpdatePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse`, and `RetrievePaymentExecutionProcedureResponse`.
