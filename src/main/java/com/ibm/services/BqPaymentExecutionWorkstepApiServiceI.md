### Functional Requirements for `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceI` Interface
#### Overview

The `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceI` interface is a Java representation of a service contract for handling operations related to payment execution worksteps. It defines a single method for retrieving details about a specific payment execution workstep.

#### Key Features

*   Represents a service interface for payment execution workstep-related operations.
*   Defines a method for retrieving payment execution workstep details.

#### Functional Requirements

1.  **Method Definition**:
    *   The interface defines 1 method:
        *   `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep(String paymentexecutionid, String paymentexecutionworkstepid)`
    *   This method is used to retrieve details about a specific payment execution workstep based on the provided `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid`.

2.  **Method Parameters**:
    *   The `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method takes two parameters:
        *   `paymentexecutionid` of type `String`
        *   `paymentexecutionworkstepid` of type `String`
    *   These parameters are used to identify the specific payment execution workstep to be retrieved.

3.  **Method Return Type**:
    *   The `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method returns an object of type `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse`.
    *   This return type represents the response containing the details of the retrieved payment execution workstep.

4.  **Documentation**:
    *   The interface and its method are documented with comments providing a description of their purpose and functionality.

#### Example Usage

```java
// Assuming a class implementing BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceI
public class BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceImpl implements BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceI {
    @Override
    public RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep(String paymentexecutionid, String paymentexecutionworkstepid) {
        // Implementation to retrieve payment execution workstep details
        // For demonstration, a simple return is shown
        return new RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse();
    }
}

BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceI service = new BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceImpl();
String paymentExecutionId = "some-payment-execution-id";
String paymentExecutionWorkstepId = "some-payment-execution-workstep-id";
RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse response = service.retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep(paymentExecutionId, paymentExecutionWorkstepId);
// Process the response
```

### Notes

*   The interface is designed to be implemented by a class that will provide the actual implementation for the defined method.
*   It is part of a larger service-oriented architecture, likely within an enterprise application or a microservices-based system.
*   The specific implementation of the `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method is expected to be provided by a class implementing this interface, which may involve database queries, API calls, or other necessary operations to retrieve the required payment execution workstep details.



## Core Business Entities
### List of Entities
* Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response
* Payment Execution Workstep

### Entity Descriptions and Relationships
#### Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response
The `Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response` represents a business entity that encapsulates the details of a payment execution workstep retrieval response.

The `Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response` is likely to be associated with or contain details about a payment execution workstep.

#### Payment Execution Workstep
The `Payment Execution Workstep` represents a business entity associated with the execution of a payment workstep. It is related to the `Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response` as the response is likely to contain details about a specific `Payment Execution Workstep` identified by `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid`.

### Relationships Between Entities
The `Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response` is related to the `Payment Execution Workstep` as it is the response to retrieving a specific `Payment Execution Workstep`. The `Payment Execution Workstep` is identified by `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid`, suggesting that `Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep Response` indirectly relates to entities or concepts represented by these identifiers.



## Business Logic Documentation

### Input & Output Data Structures

* Input: 
  - `paymentexecutionid` (string)
  - `paymentexecutionworkstepid` (string)
* Output: 
  - `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object containing details of the retrieved payment execution workstep.

### Logical Flow

1. The `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApiServiceI` interface defines a service for handling operations related to payment execution workstep.
2. The `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method takes two input parameters: `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid`.
3. Based on these input parameters, the method retrieves the details of a specific `Payment Execution Workstep`.
4. The retrieved details are encapsulated in a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.
5. The method returns the `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.

### Data Validation

- The input parameters `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid` are expected to be valid strings; however, the specific validation rules (e.g., format, length) are not defined in the provided interface.
- The `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object is expected to be a valid representation of the retrieved `Payment Execution Workstep` details.

### Business Rules

The business logic is centered around retrieving the details of a `Payment Execution Workstep` based on the provided `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid`. The retrieved details are then encapsulated in a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.

### Error Handling Approach

The interface does not explicitly define an error handling approach. It is assumed that exceptions will be handled by the implementing class or the calling code.

### Use of LE Services

- None explicitly mentioned in the provided interface.

### External Program Dependencies

- The interface depends on the `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` class, which is part of the `com.ibm.model` package.
- The implementation of this interface may depend on other classes or services not defined in the provided interface.
