## Functional Requirements
### API Endpoint: Retrieve Payment Execution Workstep

* The `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi` interface defines an API endpoint to retrieve details about a gateway transaction.
* The endpoint is accessed via a GET request to the `/PaymentExecution/{paymentexecutionid}/PaymentExecutionWorkstep/{paymentexecutionworkstepid}/Retrieve` path.

### Request Parameters

* The endpoint requires two path variables:
  * `paymentexecutionid`: a required `String` parameter representing the payment execution ID.
  * `paymentexecutionworkstepid`: a required `String` parameter representing the payment execution workstep ID.

### Response

* The endpoint returns a `ResponseEntity` containing a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.
* The response is expected to be in JSON format, as indicated by the `produces = { "application/json" }` annotation.

### HTTP Response Codes

* The endpoint is documented to return the following HTTP response codes:
  * 200: OK, with a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.
  * 400: Bad Request, with an `HTTPError` object.
  * 401: Unauthorized, with an `HTTPError` object.
  * 403: Forbidden, with an `HTTPError` object.
  * 404: Not Found, with an `HTTPError` object.
  * 429: Too Many Requests, with an `HTTPError` object.
  * 500: Internal Server Error, with an `HTTPError` object.

### Validation

* The API endpoint is validated using the `@Validated` annotation at the interface level.
* The path variables `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid` are marked as required and are constrained by `@NotNull` implicitly due to being annotated with `@PathVariable` and being required, implying that they must be present and not null in the request.

### API Documentation

* The API endpoint is documented using Swagger annotations (`@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponses`, etc.), indicating that it is part of the "BQ - PaymentExecutionWorkstep" tag.
* The API operation is described as "ReBQ Retrieve details about the gateway transaction".



## Core Business Entities
### List of Entities
* BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi
* RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse
* HTTPError

### Entity Descriptions and Relationships
#### BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi
The `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi` interface represents an API for managing payment execution worksteps. It provides a method `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` to retrieve details about a gateway transaction. The method takes in `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid` as parameters and returns a `ResponseEntity` containing a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.

The `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi` is related to:
* `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse`: The response object returned by the `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method.
* `HTTPError`: The error object returned in case of various HTTP error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500).

#### RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse
The `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` represents the response to a retrieve payment execution workstep request. 

The `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` is related to:
* `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi`: The API interface that returns a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object.

#### HTTPError
The `HTTPError` represents an HTTP error response. It is used to handle various error scenarios (BadRequest, Unauthorized, Forbidden, NotFound, TooManyRequests, InternalServerError) in the `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method of `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi`.

The `HTTPError` is related to:
* `BqPaymentExecutionWorkstepApi`: The API interface that returns an `HTTPError` object in case of HTTP error responses.



## Business Logic Documentation
### Input & Output Data Structures
The input to the `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method consists of:
* `paymentexecutionid`: a string representing the payment execution ID
* `paymentexecutionworkstepid`: a string representing the payment execution workstep ID

The output is a `ResponseEntity` containing:
* `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse`: the response object representing the retrieved payment execution workstep details for a successful response (200 status code)
* `HTTPError`: an error object representing various HTTP error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500)

### Logical Flow
1. The `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method is called with `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid` as parameters.
2. The method retrieves details about the gateway transaction based on the provided IDs.
3. If successful, it returns a `ResponseEntity` containing a `RetrievePaymentExecutionWorkstepResponse` object with a 200 status code.
4. If an error occurs, it returns a `ResponseEntity` containing an `HTTPError` object with the corresponding HTTP error status code (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500).

### Data Validation
The inputs `paymentexecutionid` and `paymentexecutionworkstepid` are annotated with `@PathVariable` and are marked as `required = true`, indicating that they are mandatory. However, there is no explicit data validation logic in the provided Java code.

### Business Rules
There are no specific business rules defined in the provided Java code. The method is primarily focused on retrieving details about a gateway transaction.

### Error Handling Approach
The `retrievePaymentExecutionWorkstep` method returns a `ResponseEntity` containing an `HTTPError` object in case of various HTTP error responses (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500). This is the error handling mechanism in the provided code.

### Use of LE(Logic Extraction) services
There is no explicit use of LE services in the provided Java code.

### External Program Dependencies
The provided Java code depends on the following external libraries:
* `org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity`
* `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable`
* `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping`
* `io.swagger.annotations.ApiOperation`
* `io.swagger.annotations.ApiResponses`
* `io.swagger.v3.oas.annotations.Parameter`
* `jakarta.validation.constraints.*` (implied by `@Validated` annotation)
