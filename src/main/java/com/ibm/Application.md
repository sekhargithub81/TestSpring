## Functional Requirements
### Application Startup

* The application is a Spring Boot application.
* The application is started using the `main` method in the `Application` class.
* The application accepts command line arguments.

### Component Scanning

* The application scans for components in the `com.ibm` package and its sub-packages.

### Spring Boot Configuration

* The application is configured using Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature.
* The application is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` to enable auto-configuration, which includes enabling component scanning for the specified base package.

### Application Launch

* The application is launched using `SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args)`, where `args` are the command line arguments passed to the application.



## Core Business Entities
### List of Entities
* Application

## Entity Descriptions and Relationships
The `Application` class is the main entry point of the Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ComponentScan` to enable auto-configuration and component scanning. The `main` method is used to launch the application. There are no other business entities defined in the provided Java code.



## Business Logic Documentation
### Input & Output Data Structures
The input to the `main` method is an array of `String` representing command line arguments (`args`). There is no explicit output data structure defined in the provided Java code. The `SpringApplication.run` method returns a `ConfigurableApplicationContext` object, but it is not used or stored in the provided code.

### Logical Flow
1. The `main` method is the entry point of the application.
2. It calls `SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args)`, passing the `Application` class and command line arguments (`args`) to it.
3. The `SpringApplication.run` method is responsible for launching the Spring Boot application.
4. The application is auto-configured and component scanning is enabled due to the `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ComponentScan` annotations on the `Application` class.

### Data Validation
There is no explicit data validation logic in the provided Java code. The `args` parameter is passed directly to `SpringApplication.run` without any validation.

### Business Rules
There are no business rules defined in the provided Java code. The code is primarily focused on launching the Spring Boot application.

### Error Handling Approach
The provided Java code does not explicitly handle any errors. The `SpringApplication.run` method may throw exceptions, but they are not caught or handled in the provided code.

### External Program Dependencies
The provided Java code depends on the following external libraries:
* `org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication`
* `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication`
* `org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan`

These dependencies are part of the Spring Boot framework and are used for auto-configuration, component scanning, and launching the application.
